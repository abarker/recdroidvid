Note, OpenCamera apparently see starting camera remotely as a security
issue, and closed an issue to start recording automatically (though it
currently seems to work for me with current way).  Note method where user
starts and stops vids should still work.

   Unfortunately there is a risk of this sort of thing being seen as a security
   issue, as any application could then get Open Camera to record videos, and
   read the result.
