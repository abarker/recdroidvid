reddroidvid
===========

Monitor and record video from Android devices remotely, and pulling and
renaming the videos when recording stops.

Currently only works over USB (via ADB).  Only tested with OpenCamera on
Android controlled from Linux.  (Windows should work in principle, but there
are some Linux-specific commands that would need alternatives.)
